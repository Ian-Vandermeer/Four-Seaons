    The Four Seasons (Italian: Le quattro stagioni) is a group of four violin concerti by Italian composer Antonio
    Vivaldi, each of which gives musical expression to a season of the year. They were written around 1721 and were
    published in 1725 in Amsterdam, together with eight additional violin concerti, as Il cimento dell'armonia e
    dell'inventione ("The Contest Between Harmony and Invention").</p>

    The Four Seasons is the best known of Vivaldi's works. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first,
    "Spring", borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera Il Giustino. The
    inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua, where Vivaldi was living at the time. They
    were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different
    species, each specifically characterized), a shepherd and his barking dog, buzzing flies, storms, drunken dancers,
    hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, and warm winter fires.
